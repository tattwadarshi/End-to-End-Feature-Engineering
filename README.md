# End-to-End-Feature-Engineering
Complete Feature Engineering.

**In this project, I will bring together various techniques for feature engineering to tackle a regression problem. This would give an idea of the end-to-end pipeline to build machine learning algorithms for regression.**

I will:
* build a lasso
* use feature-engine for the feature engineering steps
* set up an entire engineering and prediction pipeline using a Scikit-learn Pipeline

**Secondly I will show you how to use Feature-engine within the Scikit-learn pipeline, utilizing cross-validation **

I will:
* build a gradient boosted tree
* use feature-engine for the feature engineering steps
* set up an entire engineering and prediction pipeline using a Scikit-learn Pipeline
* train the pipeline with cross-validation, looking over different feature-engineering parameters

**Thirdly we will bring together various techniques for feature engineering to tackle a classification problem. This would give you an idea of the end-to-end pipeline to build machine learning algorithms for classification.**

I will:
* build a gradient boosted tree
* use feature-engine for the feature engineering steps
* set up an entire engineering and prediction pipeline using a Scikit-learn Pipeline
